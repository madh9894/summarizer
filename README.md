# Microservices Project

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of a microservices-based architecture. It includes services that communicate through defined interfaces, ensuring modularity and scalability. The application is containerized using Docker for ease of deployment.

## Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular and independently deployable services.
- **Docker Support**: Simplified containerization and orchestration.
- **Python-based Implementation**: Core functionality implemented in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic knowledge of microservices and Docker

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd EN2AR-master
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install Python dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run with Docker Compose**
   Build and start the services using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Run Locally**
   Execute the main Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Access the application through the service endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:<port>`).
- Modify the services or extend functionality by editing the respective modules in the project.
